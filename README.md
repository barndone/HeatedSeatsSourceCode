# Code backup from my 2023 Minor Production project.

As the sole programmer on this team, I was responsible for working closely with art and design throughout the entire development process of this project and my responsibilities include but were not limited to: fielding all version control/engine/or technical issues, implementing gameplay systems to design specifications, and working with design to iterate on proposed systems.
